Buddhabrot
=========

Work in progress...

This is based on code from Paul Bourke http://paulbourke.net/fractals/buddhabrot/
and inspired by j.tarbell's port http://www.complexification.net/gallery/machines/buddhabrot/

Beware, this code is very CPU intensive, but work is done in one or more Web Worker threads so
the browser UI should remain responsive (if you CPU isn't totally saturated on all cores)
